OvertimeCalculation Refactoring Kata
====================================


The `calculateOvertime` function is designed to split overtime hours into two different rates depending on the details of the particular Assignment and Briefing. 

You need to add a new feature, described below. Before that you may want to add tests and refactor the code. Note there is a branch 'with_tests' if you want to begin with the refactoring straight away.

New Feature  
------------

The threshold for overtime hours at rate 2 should be changed from 6 to 8 if the assignment is unionized and the briefing is foreign.
